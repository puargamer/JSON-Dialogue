# JSON-Dialogue

Unity implementation of a JSON dialogue system.
Reads data from external JSON files and PNG/JPG images and displays them in a "visual novel" style dialogue box.
JSON data is converted into a custom dialogue class DialogueClass containing story units called Conversations, able to be read by Unity.

There is a usable build in the Build folder.

To add custom content, insert in JSON Dialogue_Data/StreamingAssets.
